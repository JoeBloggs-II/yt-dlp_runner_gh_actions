# yt-dlp Runner
This repo runs yt-dlp on whatever url you put into "URL.txt". Pretty self-explanatory.

## How to use
Just make a fork of this repo, and set your toutube login and email as environment variables. This is mainly a practical personal project for my friends and I, as we all have the same SEO login flow thing for YouTube. If it's different, just change some of the action code to match.
