# yt-dlp Runner
This repo runs yt-dlp on whatever url you put into "URL.txt". Pretty self-explanatory.

*Currently, the URL should be dropped into the action code itself rather than the URL.txt file. It takes less than two minutes to complete, and you can download the video from the uploaded actions artifact.*
