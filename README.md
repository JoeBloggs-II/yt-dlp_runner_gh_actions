# yt-dlp Runner
This repo runs yt-dlp on whatever url you put into "URL.txt". Pretty self-explanatory.

## How to use
Just make a fork of this repo, and set your toutube login and email as environment variables. This is mainly a practical personal project for my friends and I, as we all have the same SSO login flow thing for YouTube. If yours is different (which it probably will be), just change some of the action code to match.

There is a good chance it will fail first run, don't know why this is, but usually works on the second run. If the problem persists, it's probably just the sign-in workflow code, just change it to match what you would do signing into YouTube or whatever normally.
